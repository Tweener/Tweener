### Hi there 👋

My name is Vivien, I’m 37-year-old, I'm French 🇫🇷 and living in the sunny south of France. I love cats 🐈, reading books 📚 and I do a lot of sports (🏓🤸🏋️).

For the past 13 years, I’ve been working as a mobile app developer across companies of various sizes, from early-stage startups to multinationals. And it was around the time Covid-19 hit that the idea of solopreneurship popped in my mind.

3 years later, I decided it was time to move on to a new chapter in my career. And here I am, November 2023, finally on my own, a full-time solopreneur, ready to fail and hopefully succeed!

### 🔭 I’m currently working on

As I started as an Android developer, it was only natural to take advantage of Kotlin language to write mobile apps with Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose Multiplaform.

I'm currently working on [Bloomeo](https://bloomeo.app/), an all-in-one app for budgeting, savings tracking, and planning your path to early retirement, make with KMP/CMP and available on both Android & iOS.

Also, you'll find several public repositories on my profile showcasing this work. I warmly invite you to explore them and consider contributing. Your support and contributions would be greatly valued!
