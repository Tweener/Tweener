### Hi, I'm Vivien 👋

I am a senior mobile engineer based in the south of France with more than 13 years of experience in Android and cross-platform development. In 2023 I became a full-time solopreneur, focusing on building products with **Kotlin Multiplatform** and **Compose Multiplatform**.

### 🔭 Current projects

- **[KMPShip](https://www.kmpship.app/)**: a production-ready Kotlin Multiplatform boilerplate that helps teams launch Android and iOS apps faster, with subscriptions, notifications, analytics, and clean architecture already integrated.  
- **[Bloomeo](https://bloomeo.app/)**: a mobile app built entirely with KMP and CMP (with KMPShip) that demonstrates how cross-platform technology can power polished, real-world products.  
- **Open-source libraries** that improve the KMP ecosystem:  
  - [Passage](https://github.com/TweenerLabs/passage) → Firebase authentication for KMP  
  - [Alarmee](https://github.com/TweenerLabs/alarmee) → local and push notifications for KMP  
  - [Chartopia](https://github.com/TweenerLabs/chartopia) → charting with CMP
  - [Czan](https://github.com/Tweener/czan/) → a design system for CMP

### 🎯 What I bring

I combine **deep Android expertise** with **cross-platform leadership**. My focus is on building scalable architectures, shipping production-ready apps, and improving developer experience through open source. I thrive at the intersection of product and engineering, and I am always exploring how modern tools like KMP can accelerate delivery without compromising quality.
