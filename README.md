### Hi there 👋

I'm Vivien Mahé, a senior mobile engineer based in the south of France with over 13 years of experience building Android and cross-platform apps. In 2023, I became a full-time solopreneur to focus on building great mobile products.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on

- I'm currently building [KMPShip](https://www.kmpship.app/): a Kotlin Multiplatform boilerplate that helps developers launch and monetize production-ready Android and iOS apps, without wasting time on setup.

- I'm also working on [Bloomeo](https://bloomeo.app/): an all-in-one personal finance app for budgeting, saving, and planning your path to early retirement. It's built entirely with KMP and Compose Multiplatform, and available on both Android and iOS.

- In parallel, I maintain several open-source KMP/CMP libraries, including tools for authentication, notifications, and charts, designed to make cross-platform development faster and easier for everyone.
